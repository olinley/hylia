Hola, I'm Oli (not Ollie/Olly, etc.).

Been in the game for 10 years, having started my career at Builtvisible before going in-house at Deliveroo.

These days I'm a freelance SEO consultant, mainly working with clients in the ecommerce and publishing spaces.

## What do I actually do?

I specialise in organic research and technical SEO.

To unpack that a bit, I like looking into search intent and the competitive landscape to forecast short to long term organic roadmaps.

I also like analysing server logs to find ways of improving crawlability and indexation, as well as solving larger problems like scaleable landing pages and internationalisation.

Am available on a project or retainer basis, with specialist areas including:

* Technical auditing
* Log file analysis
* International SEO (geo-targeting, hreflang and localisation)
* CMS and domain migrations
* Backlink analysis and disavow submission
* Keyword research
* Opportunity sizing
* Competitor analysis

I don’t build links.

If you're interested in working with me, then get in touch and let's shoot the proverbial.
