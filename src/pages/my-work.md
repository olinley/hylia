## Camera Jabber

I've worked with photography news and reviews site Camera Jabber since their early days in 2017. In that time I've helped them to drive +136% YoY organic visits through ongoing technical support, load time performance iterations and on-page optimisation.

Some of their greatest hits include:

* Entry into position 0 answer boxes
* AMP carousel (when Google gave carousel snippets for camera news)
* And everybody's favourite... star rating snippets

Chuffed to be considered an honourary member of their team!
