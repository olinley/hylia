## Camera Jabber

I've worked with photography news and reviews site Camera Jabber since their early days in 2017. In that time I've helped them to drive +136% YoY organic visits through ongoing technical support, load time performance iterations and on-page optimisation.

Much our focus has been around optimising existing articles rich snippet results to bolster CTR, such as answer boxes, star ratings and AMP carousel.

We've also had to overcome the challenge of ranking for new, trending products before any search data is available. By analysing historic search trends, I've worked with Camera Jabber to optimise and structure content based on product-specific search modifiers.

> Oli identifies issues before they become issues, meaning we can get ahead of any problems before they have an impact on our search performance. This period is obviously challenging for any business and everyone is looking closely at their budgets, but we deem Oli's work crucial to our ongoing operation. He's a vital asset, and we consider him part of the team.
