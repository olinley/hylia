> Oli identifies issues before they become issues, meaning we can get ahead of any problems before they have an impact on our search performance. This period is obviously challenging for any business and everyone is looking closely at their budgets, but we deem Oli's work crucial to our ongoing operation. He's a vital asset, and we consider him part of the team.
